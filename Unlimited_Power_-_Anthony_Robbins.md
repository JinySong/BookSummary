Ultimate power means creating the things you want, while producing value for others in the process. It means changing your actions and thoughts for optimal performance technologies. It has the power to transform your life.

### Ultimate Success Formula: 
Goal >> Action (don't hesitate) >> Evaluate Outcome >> Adjust and Repeat

# 1. Modeling

Find someone whom you admire and study what they are doing. Replicate their physical and mental actions.
* Pay attention to the submodalities (the smallest, most precise blocks of human experience).
* e.g. to understand a visual experience, you need to learn about color theory
* Modeling saves time to get to your goal, and requires little experience

## Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) can train your brain to achieve anything

* Our actions are governed by emotional states which can be enabling or paralyzing. Enabling states lead to resourcefulness, which leads to success.
Pay attention and learn each of your emotional states so you may manipulate your feelings towards something you hate doing, by attaching the submodalities of pleasure to it. This requires a lot of practice.

## SWISH pattern:

1. make a mental image of the behaviour you want to change
2. make a mental image of yourself having achieved the desired change
3. let the second image overlay the first, so that an automatic triggering mechanism is established. To send positive signals to your brain, accompany this process by saying "woosh" out loud.

# 2. Reframing & Anchoring

* Signals have different meaning depending on context (e.g. footsteps can be exciting with the hope of a loved one's return or scary in a horror movie)
* Nothing has an inherent meaning, and mastering reframing can help overcome traumatic experiences and/or achieve personal success

1. Context Reframing - taking  a bad experience or situation and seeing how it can be beneficial in different circumstances 
  * e.g. when other raindeers made fun of Rudolph, but his nose was useful when it was dark outside and they needed a light
2. Content Reframing - changing what a situation means to you.
  * e.g. general telling troop that they are marching in another direction instead of retreating
  * e.g. if someone is upsetting you, imagine them in a really funny voice

## Anchors
* stimuli in our environment that are linked to certain states (e.g. flag = patriotism and pride)
* effective for channeling subconscious reactions
* practice putting yourself in a state you wish to anchor by using a specific and unique stimulus during the peak of that state.

# 3. Communicating effectively
* inner (i.e. how you feel, how you picture something) - Your mental state can be controlled (i.e. you play an active part in interpreting the events of your life) and your outlook in life will determine your success.
There's no such thing as a failure, just what you make of it. It's only getting something you did not want, but in the process you still got results and feedback.
* external (i.e. any signal you send out to the world)
    * verbal - Be precise and accurately articulate
      * e.g. when a client complains about your product being expensive, you can ask, "compared to what?" With more insightful questions, you can elicit exactly what the client wants in order to make it feel enjoyable and worth his money.
    * nonverbal (i.e. mirroring the person you're speaking with)
      * Mirroring the actions of the person you are speaking with to create a bond.
      * Find out what kind of person they are. (e.g. do they respond to touch, images or sound?)
