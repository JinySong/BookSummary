‘**mens et manus**” is Latin for “mind and hand”

**Education** - imparting knowledge that is deep, contextualized, and useful. Understanding how that information connects to the world and activating it when the time comes.

**Winnowing** - the current education system is designed to separate the worthy student from the unworthy.

**learning methodologies:**
- spaced repetition - synapses are strengthened over time through a process called long-term potentiation
	- pretests before tests
	- interleaving - alternating different subjects in study schedules
- active recall after forgetting
- promote curiosity

Structure and formal instruction are necessary for effective learning at scale. The choice between traditional, structured learning and discovery learning is a false one. You can bridge the two and have the best of both worlds by
- promoting a natural curiosity
- using technology to shape raw knowledge
- also using technology to scale up to larger educational systems

## Issues with the author’s argument:
1. testing may be a form of winnowing
 - it is more of a separation of effort and understanding, than innate ability and ‘worthiness’
2. smart students may have been lost to history because of geography, gender, class, or other factors the system couldn’t account for
- earning is not the sole responsibility of the system. A student must demonstrate a willingness to learn and the work to see it through
3. learning doesn’t have to be unpleasant
- most of the time, learning requires trying new things and getting out of one’s comfort zone. You can learn through fun and games, but those methods are inefficient and require a lot of resources
4. Learning is best and natural when you’re taking in experiences and building a picture of how the world works
- much maths and humanities cannot be experienced directly. Complex theories and concepts are abstract. How do you make someone experience radial kernel functions that systematically find support vector classifiers in the infinite dimensions? How do you make someone experience the systematic annihilation of an entire race during the Holocaust?  
- a big part of learning is to find meaningful work that contributes to society. If someone does not have the basic knowledge necessary skills to be competent in a job, there will unlike be employers who are willing to guarantee hand-holding training. If learning has a practical aspect, the learning should come before the application, not the other way around.
- experiences are subjective. A student could miss a lot of necessary information without structure.
5. Learning is a survival instinct
- we do have the innate instinct to survive, but so do other animals. Do you want to live like a wild monkey?
6. the education systems favor method that could be easily measured and standardized, but they’re not always good at stimulating our natural love of learning
- these are two separate ideas: a system that stimulates a love of learning could be standardized or not standardized. Although many people do not like to take tests, it is only a form of measure and bears no effect on the method of learning. Many authors find this concept difficult to grasp. There are many different components of education. Teaching and testing are separate, you can change one without affecting the other
- is it the purpose of an educational system to stimulate a love of learning for everyone? People have different interests, and naturally have to learn different things. That’s what specializations are for. The purpose of educational systems is to provide knowledge in a clear and accessible way. A desire for learning and the ability to stick to it, are the students’ burdens. 
7. cramming is terrible for long term learning. 
- who told you to cram? it’s the students’ job not to leave everything to the last minute. There’s a reason why you don’t get to finish a whole course in a week and then do the finals immediately. 
8. promoting curiosity enhances learning
- promoting curiosity is very resource-intensive. The cost of promoting one student’s curiosity could equal the cost of giving 10,000 students an access to education. If your parents are rich, great. Unchecked resource expenditure is not viable or realistic for public educational systems.
