# The 3 forces of willpower:
1. I won't: the ability to resist temptation. Which habit is hurting your happiness, career, and life the most?
2. I will: the ability to do what you don't want to do right now for a better future. What tasks are unpleasant but necessary to achieve your goals?
3. I want: the capacity to remember what you truly want in the long term. What do you want to be 5 years from now?

# Meditation helps avoid distractions by increasing awareness and boosting self-control.
- meditation cultivates a moment-to-moment awareness. It helps = to realize when you are being distracted and brings your attention back to hand
- it only takes 3 hours to improve self-control and attention span through meditation
- after 11 hours, the changes are observable in the brain
- avoid making important decisions when you're distracted

# Willpower is a biological instinct that is meant to help us
- fight or flight response is a built-in response to help us deal with life-threatening emergencies
- pause-and-plan response shifts the focus to your internal conflicts between external desire and internal planning
- strengthen the pause-and-plan instinct by focusing on all the external stressors placed on our bodies: anxiety, chronic pain, illness
- a comfortable environment will put you in the pause-and-plan mode: eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, keep your body in shape with exercise,  spend time with friends and families, and reconnect with nature.

# Willpower can be exhausted and improved like a muscle
- there are many mundane challenges every day that will drain your willpower reserve
- strengthen the willpower muscle by performing small challenges and learn to gradually improve self-control

# Don't indulge in the present because you think you've done well in the past
- thinking of yourself as virtuous lowers your self-discipline. You think you have already done enough and stop monitoring your actions

# The brain's reward system is not always your friend
- dopamine triggers attention, motivation, and action
- anything that makes you feel good can trigger a dopamine release, which makes it very desirable
- make your brain's reward system work for you by awarding yourself after achieving something

# Negative feelings trigger cravings and high expectations
- stress is the biggest inducer of cravings because it motivates you to do something to feel better, and often times it's only a short-term relief
- deal with stress by trying things with a more sustaining effect (e.g. exercising and meditation) instead of giving into immediate cravings and feel guilty about it afterward
- when you fail to achieve a goal, don't despair. Forgive yourself and try again

# Too focused on the moment leads to bad long-term decisions
- being too focused on a commitment or being too distracted by how you're feeling in the moment distracts you from what's important in the long run
- don't leave things for your future self in the hopes of your future self will be better than your current self
- use visualization to get more familiar with your future-self. Imagine you are your future self looking back on the decisions you are making today
- temptation becomes weaker if it's at some distance, eg, by making something visible or difficult to reach

# Attempted thought suppression will make cravings worse
- why most diets don't work
- instead of thinking of depriving yourself of your favorite foods, think about how much healthy food you get to eat

# Environment plays an important role
- a strong will power instinct can be easily picked up from the environment 
- merely observing or thinking about someone with strong willpower will increase your own willpower
- if you have a goal, get your friends and family involved
