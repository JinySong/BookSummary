1. **Self-compassion** is integral to lasting change. Your expectation of yourself can be harsher than your expectation of others. Try treating yourself with the same kindness as if you have already achieved your goal.

2. A **judgment-free space** is required for lasting change. This is why some people seek to be anonymous online. You can keep a dedicated notebook for your goals, where you can write down your thoughts where others can't read it.

3. **Appreciating what you have already accomplished** and cultivate compassion . All of us already possess positives qualities and achievements that serve as evidence of our capacity to accomplish things. Focus on meeting yourself where you already are, instead of trying to find yourself.

### Create maps to know yourself better:

1. **Ways I'm happy to be** - list all your positive attributes
2. **What I'm proud of** - list all your accomplishment
3. **When I'm in the zone** - think of times when you were working toward an important goal or simply felt motivated to dedicate yourself to excel, achieve, or create. Consider the conditions that were in place that helped you succed.
4. **What hasn't worked** - identify any shortcomings that surfaced when you attempted to create change in the past.

Reflect on the maps. Identify patterns and create environments conducive to change.

Instead of labeling certain habits as 'bad' and view it as a weakness, remember we adopted these habits to serve us in some capacity. For example, people drink alcohol because it gives them self-confidence in social situations.

### Create maps to clarify your habits: ###
1. **What's the Harm** - how it's affecting your life. you might be surprised to find that your habit has affected areas of your life that you hadn't even considered
2. **Why haven't I changed already** - the reasons why you may be stuck in your ways
3. **What will test me** - identify stressors so that you may learn coping strategies. 

You might also consider keeping a journal to track your progress in the morning and at night. In the morning, note what triggering situations you might be presented with during the day and how you'd like to respond to them. At night, note how you responded throughout the day, adding any unanticipated triggers.

### Create a plan 

First, set a date to review your progress. Have dedicated time to tweak your plan with more challenging goals. A review reminder for every three weeks is a good way to start.

Keep your plan realistic and add what you feel proud of to your map.
