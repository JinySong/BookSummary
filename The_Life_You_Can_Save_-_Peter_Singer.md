Would you ruin your new shoes to save a drowning child? The answer is usually Yes. Would you donate your money to be spent on your new shoes to a charity that will save the life of a child? This second question makes people uncomfortable because it highlights the fact that people's actions don't always align with their moral compass.

The wealth gap in the world is huge, so theoretically poverty can be non-existent.

The author argues that it's wrong to keep the money for yourself if it can be used to save lives based on 3 premises:

1. people suffering is bad
2. if this suffering can be prevented without sacrificing something of equal value, it's wrong not to
3. you can prevent this suffering by simply donating to charities

# Charitable Behavior in Real Life is Often Illogical
People are more likely to give money when:
- they believe they are saving one specific life than multiple anonymous ones
- they think their actions will make a big impact as opposed to a small one
- they see others are donating as well
- donating is the default option (such as companies automatically donating a part of employees' salaries unless they opt-out)

These illogical behaviors are driven by evolutionary pressures that made us sensitive to suffering when it's small-scale and directly in front of us.

# Ways You Can Donate Better
- Pick charities that have a direct effect on the least fortunate, instead of charities that have a lot of overhead expenses.
- First, focus on caring for your own family. But after you've met their basic needs, focus on giving to the community.
- When others won't sacrifice for the greater good, it can seem unfair. Your moral compass should not depend on what others will or will not do.
- Practice donating steadily, such as giving a reasonable amount of money each year, such as 5% of your income.
