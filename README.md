This is a collection of interesting non-fiction book summaries that eventually grew to include all sorts of friendly self-help material.

My original intention was to use the data to create a dashboard of my reading preferences. With more data, it could also serve in NLP exercises in the future.

Much of the data originated from two mobile apps: Blinkist and 12min. Both offer a free, short audio summary of a book each day. Together they make excellent replacements for other streams of fragmented and extremely addictive information on popular social media platforms. They have become a comfortable companion of curated infosource in an age of information overload. 

Reading is one of my favourite hobbies, and I have a goodreads account that I'm always trying to keep updated. If you enjoy books, and reading or writing reviews, please considering adding me as a friend at https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s. I love to get connected with people who share the same interests in books as I do. And I would love to be your friend on Goodreads and follow your reviews.
