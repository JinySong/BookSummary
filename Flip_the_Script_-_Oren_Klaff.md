In the age of the internet, people can get all the information they need to make an important decision before they meet the salesperson. To convince customers to take the step and buy from you, you need to establish a rapport. Raise yourself to the same status as your customers so you can be perceived to be an equal

E.g. in the aftermath of a car accident, a wife uses medical jargon to communicate with the doctor, and thereby give a status tipoff of her status as a medical professional.

# How to achieve status alignment:
Ans: with research and preparation

E.g. you're in real estate and speaking to a client considering moving to another state:
1. use jargon to demonstrate you understand her industry
2. introduce yourself by mentioning a client you recently moved for
3. show your research by listing the pros and cons of moving to the state she's considering

# How to prove yourself as an expert
Ans: by creating a flash roll, a 60 to 90 seconds rapid-fire explosion of information designed to showcase your absolute command of a complicated subject. 
1. assess the problem casually, like it’s something you deal with every day
2. describe it in detail, using every technical term available to you
3. finish with a solution, the deal you’re trying to make

Avoid “I think” or “in my opinion”. Deliver it quickly and without emotion. Make it second nature: script, practice, and memorize. 

# Anticipate pre-wired ideas
1. threat - people snap to attention when they hear something that threatens them or their status
	- why should they care?
	- e.g. the world is changing and the customer is in danger of being left behind. The only way to keep up is to purchase your product
2. reward - everyone is looking for the next payoff
	- what’s in it for them?
	- the magic number is ‘times 2’: a TV that comes out that offers twice the resolution; you will double your client’s productivity; you can cut the operating expense in half
3. fairness - customers need to know that we are just as invested as they are
	- why pick you to help them
	- craft a short script that demonstrates how committed you are, whether it’s financially, physically or contractually
	- your evil of investment should be at least as large, if not more, than what you’re asking of your potential client

# Frame your proposal in terms of what’s comfortable and familiar ideas to the client
- when you are giving a pitch, describe it in plain vanilla terms
- group the new features together and demonstrate what you’re offering is the new normal
- e.g. when presenting a miniature golf bar concept, focus on the extensive beer selection, the great chefs, the parking, etc… When it comes to introducing the golf idea, show how themed bars are booming in popularity and they are becoming the new normal.
- no matter how unique your proposal is, it needs to trace back to something familiar
- it’s a delicate balance between the old and the new

# Leverage pessimism
- forced optimism pressures the buyer. The buyer’s questions come from a healthy skepticism that they’re being offered something too good to be true
- use the buyer’s formula to encourage the buyer to feel she’s in control of the process, while allowing you to direct the process to your advantage
- offer counterintuitive things the customer might not have considered and list the options and end with “a lot of things go into a decision like this but only these three really matter. Focus on them and everything else will sort itself out.”
- learn to direct the client’s concerns where you want them go, so you can easily overcome any objections

# Be authentic
- the 2 things busy respond to consistently: authenticity and expertise
- people can see through most obvious sales tactics and charisma isn’t the defining trait of a successful, compelling salesperson
